**Breast Cancer Prediction with Machine Learning** is a comprehensive project that showcases the application of Support Vector Machine (SVM) in the predictive analysis of breast cancer diagnosis. It features a detailed exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's dynamics, followed by rigorous data preprocessing to enhance the predictive model's accuracy. The project is structured methodically from data acquisition to model optimization. This project provides a good understand of machine learning applications in healthcare and a practical guide for implementing SVM in a real-world predictive task.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to a dataset to predict breast cancer diagnosis. The Jupyter notebook `Breast_Cancer_Prediction.ipynb` provides a step-by-step analysis and modeling.

## Data Sources
The data for this project is stored in `.csv` files:
- `data.csv`: Original dataset.
- `data_clean.csv`: Cleaned dataset ready for analysis.
- `data_clean_id.csv`: Dataset with identifiers removed.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The Jupyter notebook includes visualization and exploration of the dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Data Preprocessing
This section of the notebook covers feature selection and dimensionality reduction to enhance the predictive power of the model.

## Predictive Modeling
We build a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict the diagnosis of breast tumors and evaluate it using a confusion matrix and ROC curves.

## Model Optimization
We fine-tune the parameters of the SVM classifier to improve the model's performance using scikit-learn's tools.

## Conclusion
The notebook concludes with an assessment of the model's performance and potential areas for further research and improvement.
